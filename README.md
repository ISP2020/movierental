## Movie Rental Refactoring

This classic refactoring problem is from Chapter 1 of
_Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_ by Martin Fowler.  

The repository contains Python code translated from the original Java version.

The runnable `main.py` creates a customer and prints a statement.

The [PDF from Chapter 1][refactoring_pdf] explains the 
motivation for each refactoring and how to do it.  Please read it.

## Instructions

See [Movie Rental Refactoring, Part 1](https://cpske.github.io/assignment/movierental/movie-rental1)

Before and after each refactoring you should **run the unit tests**.
